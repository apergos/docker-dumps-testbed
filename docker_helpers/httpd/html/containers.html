    <h1>SQL/XML Dumps Testbed Containers</h1>
    <p>
      This testbed consists of a number of Docker containers, all in the same Docker network so that they can communicate
      seamlessly with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <dt>&lt;networkname&gt;-httpd</dt>
      <dd>
	This is an app server instance that serves MediaWiki. You can look at the pages of the wikis that have been set up
	for testing, by browsing to this instance from the host computer running the testbed. URLs should be of the form
	http://&lt;networkname&gt;-httpd.&lt;networkname&gt;.lan/&lt;wikiname&gt;/mw/index.php?title=SomeTitleHere but that
	will depend in part on the directory tree you have set up with MediaWiki versions for each test wiki.
      </dd>
      <dt>&lt;networkname&gt;-phpfpm</dt>
      <dd>
	This is a php-fpm instance to which all web requests for php scripts are sent. You should never have to interact with
	it directly.
      </dd>
      <dt>&lt;networkname&gt;-dbprimary</dt>
      <dd>
	This is the primary database server instance. It should contain one database with all of the releveant tables, per
	test wiki. You can query the database from the host computer running the testbed, using any mysql-compatible
	client, connecting as the root user with the password that you have configured. You can also connect to it from any
	instance in the testbed, using the same credentials.
      </dd>
      <dt>&lt;networkname&gt;-dbreplica-NN (SOON)</dt>
      <dd>
	These are database replica server instances. You do not need these to run the testbed, but you may wish to check that,
	for example, during a dumps run, no write requests are sent to the primary server, and it can be handy having one or
	more replicas where all read requests would go. Likewise, you can set up your MediaWiki configuration to use
	multiple replicas with requests for certain wikis going only to certain instances, and verify in your particular
	set of tests that this works as expected.
      </dd>
      <dt>&lt;networkname&gt;-dbextstore (SOON)</dt>
      <dd>
	If this is configured, all wikitext is stored here instead of directly in the dbprimary and/or dbreplica instances.    
	This is not required in order to run the testbed, but the Wikimedia production cluster uses such an external store,
	so you may wish to do the same, if you are concerned with having a setup that is as close to production as
	possible.
      </dd>
      <dt>&lt;networkname&gt;-dumpsdata (SOON)</dt>
      <dd>
	If this is configured, dumps output files are written to this instance from the snapshot instances, via an NFS
	share. This is not required in order to run the testbed, but you may wish to test out locking and other things
	that can be tricky on NFS. The Wikimedia production cluster has such NFS servers and so any dumps code must
	function in such a setup.
      </dd>
      <dt>&lt;networkname&gt;-snapshot-NN</dt>
      <dd>
	These are snapshot instances, the instances on which you may launch the dump generation script. You may configure
	only one instance if you wish, but this means that you will not be able to run tests involving parallel generation
	of dumps content for the same wiki across multiple hosts. You will, however, be able to configure all other dump
	tests.
