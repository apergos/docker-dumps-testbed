    <h1>Welcome to the SQL/XML Dumps testbed</h1>
    <h2>BIG FAT WARNING</h2>
    <p>
      This is pre-alpha software. Expect bugs, sudden refactoring, and the possiblity that it will cause your laptop
      to catch fire. In other words, try it out at your own risk!
    </p>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      You have reached the main page of the SQL/XML Dumps testbed. This server is a mediawiki app/api container running apache.
      It communicates with a php-fpm instance that processes all requests except those for static content.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this container listens on port 80, and should be available from the laptop or desktop running these containers,
      a separate web server may also be running and serving dump output files on 8080, if you have so configured the testbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be able to ssh into any container from your laptop or desktop, giving the fqdn of the container. The root
      password is "testing", and we plan to make that configurable in a future release.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the document <a href="/containers.html">Testbed Containers</a> describing the various containers and what they do, or just
      <code>docker ls</code> when they are running; the names should be pretty self-explanatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      To check that the php-fpm container(s) are running properly, you may visit <a href="/hello.php"></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This testbed uses the PHP Opcache. If you make live changes to the version of MediaWiki being run in these
      containers, you'll need to invalidate the opcache without causing the container to exit. You can
      do that by visiting the <a href="/invalidate-cache.php">Opcache invalidation</a> page.
    </p>

      Please send bug reports, comments and suggestions to ops-dumps@wikimedia.org. Enjoy!
