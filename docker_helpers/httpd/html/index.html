<h1>Welcome to the SQL/XML Dumps testbed</h1>
<p>
  You have reached the main page of the SQL/XML Dumps testbed. This server is a mediawiki app/api container running apache.
  It doesn't have a copy of mediawiki itself, but rather communicates with a php-fpm instance that processes all requests
  except those for static content.
</p>
<p>
  While this container listens on port 80, and should be available from the laptop or desktop running these containers,
  a separate web server may also be running and serving dump output files on 8080, if you have so configured the testbed.
</p>
<p>
  You should be able to ssh into any container from your laptop or desktop, giving the fqdn of the container. The root
  password is "testing" and we plan to fix that up in a future release.
</p>
<p>
  See the document (TBD) describing the various containers and what they do, or just
  <code>docker ls</code> when they are running; the names should be pretty self-explanatory.
</p>
<p>
  Bug reports to (TBD). Enjoy!
